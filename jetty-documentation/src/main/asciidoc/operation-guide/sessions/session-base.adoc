=== The Base Sessions Module
The `sessions` module is the base module that all other session modules depends upon.
As such it will be _transitively_ enabled if you enable any of the other session modules: you need to _explicitly_ enable it if you wish to _change_ any settings from their defaults.

Enabling the `sessions` module puts the `$jetty.home/etc/sessions/id-manager.xml` file onto the execution path and generates a `$jetty.base/start.d/sessions.ini` file.

The `id-manager.xml` file instantiates a `DefaultSessionIdManager` and `HouseKeeper`.
The former is used to generate and manage session ids whilst the latter is responsible for periodic scavenging of expired sessions.

The `sessions.ini` file can be used to configure them.

==== Configuration

jetty.sessionIdManager.workerName::
This uniquely identifies the jetty server instance within a cluster.
If you have more than one Jetty instance, it is *crucial* that you configure the worker name differently on each jetty instance.
You can either provide a value for this property, or you can allow jetty to try and synthesize a workerName - the latter option is _only_ advisable in the case of a single, non-clustered deployment.
There are two ways jetty will try to synthesize a default `workerName`:

* if running on GoogleAppEngine, the `workerName` will be formed by concatenating the values of the environment variables `JETTY_WORKER_INSTANCE` and `GAE_MODULE_INSTANCE`
* otherwise, the `workerName` will be formed by concatenating the environment variable `JETTY_WORKER_INSTANCE` and the literal `0`.


jetty.sessionScavengeInterval.seconds::
This is the period in _seconds_ between runs of the `HouseKeeper`, responsible for orchestrating the removal of expired sessions.
By default it will run every 600 secs (ie 10 mins).
As a rule of thumb, you should  ensure that the scavenge interval is shorter than the  `<session-timeout>` of your sessions to ensure that they are promptly scavenged.

[TIP]

Don't forget that the `<session-timeout>` is specified in web.xml in _minutes_ and the vaue of the `jetty.sessionScavengeInterval.seconds` is in _seconds_.
